# Single Wheel Car Suspension Simulation
This program simulates the behaviour of a single car wheel going through a series of road bumps
at variable speed. Two models are available: one simulating a spring with all other components
being rigid and another with the added simulation of a compressible tire.

All simulations are based on the Euler-Cromer method.
